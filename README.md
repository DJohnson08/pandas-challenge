This dataset had several interesting factors when analyzing these schools. We could pull individual schools and students alike as well as grades and budgets. The thing I noticed most was the variance of scores when it came to reading and math. We could conclude that reading is more prioritized, or the students prefer the reading teachers due to their willingness to study and pass the test. Often students will say math is a more favorable subject, but this dataset shows otherwise.

The second glaring thing that stood out was the school budgets. It makes sense that a larger school would have a larger budget, but my gut would’ve told me a few hundred thousand dollars not millions. The per student budget is quite similar, which is good to know that no student is truly left behind. I believe curriculum is more of a factor in determining scores and the budget per student wouldn’t alter scores. It was odd to see that some of the higher budget per student scored in the bottom 5, would be nice to see more data or dive into why. There was no real correlation with grades and scores either, it seemed like at every level, students were getting similar grades. So by that I could tell it was more of a school concern, not a students age or interest.

The limits of this data are the amount of schools it was pulled from, we see some are district and some charter but if we had a larger sample or more in the surrounding area we could really find out some more reasoning behind the numbers.
